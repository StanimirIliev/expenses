Usage:

Creating new expense:

When creating new expense option 'n' should be used,
to define that this is going to be a new expense.
Options 'k', 'd', 'a' and 'D' means 'kind', 'description',
'amount' and 'date' respectively. 'k' and 'd' takes string as
argument, 'a' takes double and 'D' accepts date format. When
creating new expense only 'k' and 'a' options are mandatory.

Examples:

expenses -n -k Kind -d 'String with spaces needs quotes' -a 5.1
expenses -n -k Kind -D '2018-04-23' -a 5,1

Updating existing expense:

When editing expense option 'e' should be used, which also takes
the id of the expense as argument. Options 'k', 'd', 'a' and 'D'
are used to update the existing data of the expense and each of
them is not required.

Examples:

expenses -e 15 -k 'new kind'
expenses -e 15 -D '2018/05/17'
expenses -e 15 -k 'new kind' -d 'new description' -a 5.9 -D '2018/05/17'

Deleting expense:

When deleting expense option 'delete' should be used which takes
the id of the expense as argument.

Examples:

expenses --delete 15

Prints expenses:

To print the expenses, option 'p' should be used. Although there are two
exceptions. When using the options 'printKindsOnly' and 'printMonthsAmount'
option 'p' should be omitted.

Examples:

expenses -p //prints all expenses
expenses -p -k 'kind1, kind2'// prints all expenses with kinds 'kind1' and 'kind2'
expenses -p -k 'kind1, kind2' --startDate '2018.01.01' --endDate '2018-07-12'
                                                            // prints all expenses
                                                                with kinds 'kind1'
                                                                and 'kind2' within
                                                                the selected period
expenses -p --startDate '2018.01.01' --endDate '2018-07-12'// prints all expenses
                                                             within the provided
                                                             dates including them
expenses --printKindsOnly// prints all kinds
expenses --printMonthsAmount// prints the total amount for each month
